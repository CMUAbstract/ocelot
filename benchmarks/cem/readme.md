This benchmark is a logging and compression application, originally used in [DINO](https://github.com/CMUAbstract/dino/tree/master/Tests).
This is mostly a compute application; it samples from a simulated temperature sensor and runs a 
tree-based compression algorithm
The Ocelot annotation will enforce that the sample is fresh before it is compressed.
