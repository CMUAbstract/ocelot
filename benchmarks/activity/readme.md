This benchmark is an activity recogntion application, originally used in [DINO](https://github.com/CMUAbstract/dino/tree/master/Tests).
It classifies a window of readings as moving or stationary, using a simulated accelerometer.
The Ocelot annotations will enforce that the x, y, z coordinate readings are always consistent, 
and that the readings to be classified are fresh.
